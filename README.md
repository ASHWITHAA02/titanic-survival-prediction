# Titanic Survival Prediction 

This is a data science project where we build a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster or not.

Objective

To analyze the Titanic dataset and create a model that can predict survival using features like:
- Passenger Class
- Sex
- Age
- Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- Number of parents/children aboard
- Fare, and more

Process Involved:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing using pandas and NumPy
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using seaborn and matplotlib
- Handling missing values
- Converting categorical values to numeric
- Building a basic machine learning model using `sklearn`
- Evaluating model accuracy
- Working with Jupyter Notebook in VS Code
- Pushing project to GitHub using Git

Libraries Used:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

Model Accuracy:

The model achieved an accuracy of around 80%

Method to Run:

1. Clone this repo
2. Install libraries from `requirements.txt`
3. Open `titanic.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code
4. Run all cells to view output
